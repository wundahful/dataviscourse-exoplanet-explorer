## Summary
Our feedback session helped me come up with fresh ideas for how to present an overview context. Overall, we ended up focusing more on UX rather than information design or scope. With such a small amount of time for feedback, it's a little difficult to tell if that's a result of the constraints or a result of a well-considered project. Because it was so loosely structured and the user research wasn't via a targeted audience, it felt only a little helpful.
