# Background and Motivation
My research group is The OpenSpace project (openspaceproject.com). We're building an open source planetary & cosmological visualization platform. The primary application is for use in planetarium shows, public outreach, and in the classroom. NASA and space research institutions are also involved to guide its development toward becoming a useful research tool as well, especially for studying solar weather.
  
While others are beginning work on information visualization for solar dynamics research, my goal is to focus more on the outreach side. I'm primarily interested in improving communication of complex science (especially visually), and I think exoplanet discovery is one of the more tangible and inspiring research themes that can be shared.

# Project Objectives
This project will involve a browser-based exoplanet explorer. Eventually, it will integrate with the OpenSpace package to interactively update along with navigation inside OpenSpace. It will present the exoplanets that have been confirmed by the Kepler mission data at https://kepler.nasa.gov/index.cfm (there are actually a few missions involved, but Kepler is the most recognizable). By presenting information in a relatable scale, I’d like to inspire discovery of the universe and space exploration.

My proposal is to showcase these planets in relation to our solar system and Earth: how far away they are, how their orbits, mass, & day lengths compare to Earth’s, and if they’re possibly habitable. Furthermore, I’d compare similar metrics for their star vs. the Sun. A final goal might be to do some more traditional information visualization over the entire dataset to analyze exoplanet statistics. However, it’s more important to me create an exploration portal that shows relationships to Earth rather than to provide a technical measurement and analysis tool.

My original intent is a heads-up-display style console. As you navigate inside of OpenSpace, it feeds the camera frustum to the Exoplanet Explorer, which then loads information about planets within the current viewport. Since OpenSpace has many hardware and software requirements, I envision this display as a standalone viewer to reduce the amount of investment the average user needs to get involved with the project. Users can select planets at simplest with a list, but possibly by region or a map. Hopefully the easy access to this web tool will also drive engagement by inspiring users to take the time to install and use the full OpenSpace package.

# Data
Data will come from the NASA Exoplanet Archive hosted by CalTech. I plan to mostly use the confirmed planet database, but may need to integrate additional sources.

# Data Processing
The data seems relatively clean for the confirmed planets, and most data are presented in units relative to the Earth and Sun, so it shouldn't require much processing. There's also an API available, which should make accessing updated data very simple. The biggest processing to be done will likely be calculating habitable zones based on star types. There might also be some not-insignificant work to process the light curve/transit data.

# Visualization Design
### Design 1: Heads-Up Display
The Heads-Up Display presents mainly blown-up views. We use animated location to encode the orbit's distance and velocity. In a separate panel, we also use area to encode size, and feature direct data to show information about selection. There's an overall galactic map to display distance and give context, but

It is able to encode quite a bit of information about each individual planet effectively, but provides less analysis of the overall picture. It also relies somewhat on displaying direct data instead of an encoding.

### Design 2: Analytics Console
The Analytics Console would be magic-window style implementation. It begins with an overview bar chart of the number of habitable planets within distance bins. As you select areas of the galactic map via a window (connected to OpenSpace), the, encoding can change to show a detail view. The example presented is a scatter plot of Distance to the Sun vs. "Most Earthlike," and ordinal metric that would need to be curated. Other views would be possible to break out more. Tooltips can present even finer detail on an individual datum.

This view presents information in a very explorable manner, with access to many levels of information. Despite this, the clinical nature of the presentation has the potential to stymie engagement if the styling isn't well considered.

### Design 3: Vitruvian Planet
The Vitruvian Planet design is meant to show how the values cluster around an ideal planet i.e. the Earth. It would be a scatterplot presentation with Earth at the center of interactive axes. The data could be changed to compare gravity against distance to the sun, or temperature vs. size, easily showing how they directly compare to Earth. The color and size channels of the marks could also be used to encode different information from chart to chart, but more likely would show size and temperature across all other values.

This presentation has a more compelling encoding & interactivity than the Analytics Console, and a more analytical approach than the Heads-Up Display. However, it may try to encode too much information in too small of a space, and the scaling may become a factor, especially since we're dealing with Very Large Numbers™.

### Design 4: Composite
The composite design takes the Vitruvian Planet and integrates it into the Heads Up Display. Design 1 is lacking in overall view and Design 3 is perhaps too direct. I feel that combining them elevates both concepts. The combination provides the more playful multimedia experience I'm trying to obtain while also introducing a deeper, meaningful level of analytics.
