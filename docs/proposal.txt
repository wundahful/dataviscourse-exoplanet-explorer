# Background and Motivation
My research group is The OpenSpace project (openspaceproject.com). We're building an open source planetary & cosmological visualization platform. The primary application is for use in planetarium shows, public outreach, and in the classroom. NASA and space research institutions are also involved to guide its development toward becoming a useful research tool as well, especially for studying solar weather.
  
While others are beginning work on information visualization for solar dynamics research, my goal is to focus more on the outreach side. I'm primarily interested in improving communication of complex science (especially visually), and I think exoplanet discovery is one of the more tangible and inspiring research themes that can be shared.

# Project Objectives
This project will involve a browser-based exoplanet explorer. Eventually, it will integrate with the OpenSpace package to interactively update along with navigation inside OpenSpace. It will present the exoplanets that have been confirmed by the Kepler mission data at https://kepler.nasa.gov/index.cfm (there are actually a few missions involved, but Kepler is the most recognizable). By presenting information in a relatable scale, I’d like to inspire discovery of the universe and space exploration.

My proposal is to showcase these planets in relation to our solar system and Earth: how far away they are, how their orbits, mass, & day lengths compare to Earth’s, and if they’re possibly habitable. Furthermore, I’d compare similar metrics for their star vs. the Sun. A final goal might be to do some more traditional information visualization over the entire dataset to analyze exoplanet statistics. However, it’s more important to me create an exploration portal that shows relationships to Earth rather than to provide a technical measurement and analysis tool.

My original intent is a heads-up-display style console. As you navigate inside of OpenSpace, it feeds the camera frustum to the Exoplanet Explorer, which then loads information about planets within the current viewport. Since OpenSpace has many hardware and software requirements, I envision this display as a standalone viewer to reduce the amount of investment the average user needs to get involved with the project. Users can select planets at simplest with a list, but possibly by region or a map. Hopefully the easy access to this web tool will also drive engagement by inspiring users to take the time to install and use the full OpenSpace package.

# Data
Data will come from the NASA Exoplanet Archive hosted by CalTech. I plan to mostly use the confirmed planet database, but may need to integrate additional sources.

# Data Processing
The data seems relatively clean for the confirmed planets, and most data are presented in units relative to the Earth and Sun, so it shouldn't require much processing. There's also an API available, which should make accessing updated data very simple. The biggest processing to be done will likely be calculating habitable zones based on star types. There might also be some not-insignificant work to process the light curve/transit data.

# Visualization Design
